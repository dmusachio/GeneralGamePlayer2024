Commentary: we decided to implement and upload our greedy player because it performed very well in a wide variety of single player and multiplayer games. The idea of a greedy player is to represent states as nodes and to expand nodes as needed as the game goes on. The way the greedy algorithm works in our implementation is when calculating the value, we look at the utility of the node. The highest utility score (referred to as exploitation) means that this node has led to favorable outcomes for our player the most out of any node. We have found that our player is performing better on large state games, like Skirmish, also because we implemented a deadline feature that ensures that we have a move before the deadline.
